#log into HPC with
ssh myusername@hpcadress -p portnumber

#move into correct folder
cd Catharina/Awesomeprojects

#check nodes that are active and move into one that is suitable. Do not use management console or super node ( “console02” etc or “smp”). Use lsload to see available nodes and then ssh into an available node

#create a new environment
conda create -n myenvironmentname

#move into correct environment
conda activate myenvironmentname

#to check available environments 
conda info --envs

#use crt + z to move out of a program such as R

#the place you are working from should now say: (phenology) [myusername@c0104 Catharina/Awesomeprojects]$
#now you can start installing packages

#if conda need to be installed download it first for linux 64bit x86 from https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual

#install R if it is not already and specify version
R —version #to check version
conda install -c r r=3.4.0

#for phenology:
conda install -c conda-forge r-readr
conda install -c r r-dplyr
conda install -c conda-forge r-factoextra
conda install -c r r-cluster
conda install -c r r-doparallel
conda install -c r r-tidyr
conda install -c conda-forge r-purrr
conda install -c r r-ggplot2

#to install packages for R
conda install r-package_name

#for rgdal the code is
conda install --channel condo-forge/label/cf201901 r-rgdal

#move the files into the folder you want to work with using Fugu software (on mac)

#now you can submit the job using the nohup command, the & at the end is needed to ensure it continuous running after you log out etc
nohup Rscript scriptname &
nohup Rscript Anura_PGLS_final_HPC.R & #example

#thsi will produce a nohup.put file where any errors will be placed, read them with code below or simply export file to computer using Fugu:
less nohup.out

#to rename output file
nohup Rscript Test_file2.R > nohup4.out &

#check what is running, this is where you get the PID number (job number) 
top -c

#if you accidentally put on multiple jobs or need to kill it for another reason (make sure you don't kill other peoples jobs)
kill PID_number
